# Weight Transfer Panel for Blender

This script implements an add-on for the 3D modelling program [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), utilising Blender's [Python API](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/index.html). This add-on aims to remove a few steps in between the weight transfer process between meshes and replacing it with an easy-access menu.

# Future Aims

- Implement config files
- Allow user to create config files for different weight transfer types
