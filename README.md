# Weight Transfer Panel

This script implements an add-on for the 3D modelling program Blender. This add-on aims to remove a few steps in between the weight transfer process between meshes and replacing it with an easy-access menu.

# Future Aims

- Implement config files
- Allow user to create config files for different weight transfer types
